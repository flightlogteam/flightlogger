# A better flightlogger
flightlog.org is a great site. This project is a modern implementation of that webpage with a similar data-model, written in golang

# Architecture
Here we use a layered model in order to ensure security. The backend API will basically have two layers

### Frontend
- Angular Cli (coming soon)

### Backend
- Presentation-layer
- Business (UseCase)
- Datalayer

# Project setup

## Dependencies
* golang
* git

Please also set the GOHOME environment variable should be $HOME/go

## Project setup
1. `go get github.com/klyngen/flightlogger`. 
2. Generate certificates 
```bash
openssl genrsa -out fly.rsa 2048
openssl rsa -in app.rsa -pubout > fly.rsa.pub
```
3. Migrate the database...
4. Add configuraion preferrably to $HOME/.flightlogger/flightlog.yaml
```yaml
serverport: "61225"
publicKeyPath: "$HOME/.flightlogger/fly.rsa.pub"
privateKeyPath: "$HOME/.flightlogger/fly.rsa"
# Expiration in seconds
tokenexpiration: 3600

database:
   hostname: "canbeempty"
   password: "dbpassword"
   port: "canbeempty"
   username: "dbuser"
   database: "Flightlog"
```

5. `go run main.go`

# Contributions
All help is appreciated. Send me an email if you wonder how you can contribute or just make a PR. 

## Guidelines
- Ensure that the API is easy to use. Please reed [this guide](https://blog.florimond.dev/restful-api-design-13-best-practices-to-make-your-users-happy)
- **Write tests** the application is layered for a reason....
- Be nice :)
